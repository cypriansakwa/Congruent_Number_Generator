This Rust program generates sequences of positive and negative numbers that are congruent to a specific number modulo a particular modulus. 
The program lets you generate a specified number of these congruent numbers.

The program creates two sequences of numbers:

1. Positive Congruent Numbers: Those that are congruent to a specific number modulo a given modulus, beginning with the stated number and increasing by the modulus.
2. Negative Congruent Numbers: Those that are congruent to a particular number modulo a given modulus, beginning with the stated number and decreasing by the modulus.
